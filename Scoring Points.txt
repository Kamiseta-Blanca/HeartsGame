Scoring Points:

Points are scored after the end of each hand.
Players count up the amount of Hearts cards they've won during the hand, with each Hearts card they have netting them one point.
A special case is the Queen of Spades, which nets the player 13 points instead.

Another special case is known as Shooting the Moon, in which a player has won all 13 Hearts cards and the Queen of Spades in their pile.
If a player has Shot the Moon, that player earns no points while everyone else earns an additional 26 points.

If a player reaches or goes over the amount of points set at the beginning, then the game ends with the player with the lowest number of points at that time winning.
If a player does not reach or goes over the amount of points set at the beginning, then the cards are reshuffled and dealt out again, with a new Hand starting once again.
