Starting Off:

There will be four players in this program available. They can either be CPUs or another player.

You will be seated in this formation:

                #1


        #4               #2


                #3

Each player will have a total of 13 cards dealt to them, and there will be no Jokers. This is a normal Deck of 52 cards.
